                  Self-Managed and Developed a Data life-cycle framework (Datalake Jumpstarter Framework) that can be used to ingest nearly every file type like xml, json, text, csv, parquet etc.
                    The framework was built over Unity Catalog and Delta Live Tables provided by Databricks.
                    The framework allows data streaming, automated data quality testing and data governance. It is highly scalable since it uses Delta Live tables technology from databricks internally
                    and has trigger time isolation along with parallel processing of notebooks/scripts implemented in python. Integration and setting up was simplified by requiring the 
                    developer who uses the framework to setup only configurations with minimal to no-coding required. Environment isolation control was implemented for users to develop their ETL's in dev,prod, etc. settings.
                    The framework was used in the GMG and Cenomi projects mentioned below. All documentation on how to setup the framework was documented in Notion
